# All of Statistics

Solutions to [Wasserman's 'All Of Statistics'](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-0-387-21736-9), using the 2005 corrected second printing, ISBN 0-387-40272-1.

## Organisation

Please follow these guidelines:

* Solutions go in [solutions](/solutions) as markdown or notebook (ipynb). They should be labelled `chXXqYY` where `XX` is the (0 padded) chapter number and `YY` is the (0 padded) question number.  For example, question 3 from chapter 7 should be labelled `ch07q03`.
* Anything useful/reusable/more involved should go in [chapters](/chapters).
* Datasets go in [data](/data).
* Use python 3, not python 2.

Some more mathematical solutions may be found [on the blog](https://stappit.github.io/categories/allofstatistics.html).
